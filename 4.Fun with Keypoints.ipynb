Here's how the transparency channel works: the lower the value, the more transparent, or see-through, the pixel will become.  The lower bound (completely transparent) is zero here, so any pixels set to 0 will not be seen; these look like white background pixels in the image above, but they are actually totally transparent. \n","\n","This transparent channel allows us to place this rectangular image of sunglasses on an image of a face and still see the face area that is techically covered by the transparentbackground of the sunglasses image!\n","\n","Let's check out the alpha channel of our sunglasses image in the next Python cell.
